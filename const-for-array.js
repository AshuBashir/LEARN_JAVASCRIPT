//use const for creating array

const fruits = ["apple", "mango"]; // actually in const, there is address of the array and not the items , we can change the array via this, fruits = ["grapes"]; but it will show errorbz it is const and not let or var.
fruits.push("banana");
console.log(fruits);

//we use const mainly for arrays.
